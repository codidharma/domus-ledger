**Context**: Development, Testing

**Author**: Mandar Dharmadhikari


## Context

Domus Ledger is a desktop application designed to manage personal and household finances using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It follows a modular monolith architecture with clearly defined bounded contexts like Household Management, Budgeting, Investments, and Liabilities Tracking.

The project needs a robust, modern, type-safe, and enterprise-ready platform that can support:
- Domain modeling and complex business logic
- Clean architecture principles
- Cross-platform desktop UI
- Integration with modern CI/CD pipelines
- Testability and modular design
- Long-term maintainability and community support

## Decision

We will build Domus Ledger using the **.NET platform** (specifically .NET 8 and above) as the primary application stack.

### Key Technologies:
- **C#** as the primary language
- **.NET SDK** for building and packaging
- **Avalonia UI** for cross-platform desktop user interfaces
- **EF Core** for data access and ORM
- **xUnit** for testing (unit, integration, architecture)
- **SQLite** as the embedded database

## Consequences

- The team must be proficient in C# and .NET.
- The codebase will be organized using .NET's multi-project structure aligned with DDD modules.
- All devs will require .NET SDK (8+) and Avalonia UI tooling.
- CI/CD pipelines will be built using `dotnet` CLI commands.
- Unit, integration, and architecture tests will be built using xUnit.
- Strong typing and modular architecture will support maintainability and scaling.

## Alternatives Considered

- Java
- Node and Javascript
